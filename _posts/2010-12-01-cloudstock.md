Next week 5000 developers are going to descend on San Francisco to take part in CloudStock - the premier event for cloud application developers. And to amplify the fun, you can compete in CloudStock hackathon for one of [many prizes](http://www.cloudstockevent.com/cloudstockhackathon).

## Start hacking now!
You can win a iPod touch 32GB for the "Best Analytic Innovation" prize sponsored by GoodData. So get working now. Here is a short jump-start guide to get you running quickly:

* register for a [free account](https://secure.gooddata.com/registration.html)
* we've created a command-line utility called [GoodData CL](/gooddata-cl) to help you use GoodData APIs
* watch this [quick screencast](http://developer.gooddata.com/start/load-in-5-minutes.html) showing you a setup of a sample analytical project (follow the text along, download all the sample scripts)
* here's a bit [more background](http://developer.gooddata.com/start/) on what's happening under-the-hood

Give us a shout at [@gooddata_dev](http://twitter.com/gooddata_dev) if you have any questions, or our [Developer Forum](http://support.gooddata.com/forums/176660-developer-forum). We'll be focusing heavily to help you move quickly.

And of course, come see us on CloudStock. We'll be both manning the booth and roaming the hackathon, some of our best developers giving you hands-on support on the spot. We're excited to see what you come up with!
