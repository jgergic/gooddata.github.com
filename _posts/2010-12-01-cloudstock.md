Next week 5000 developers are going to descend on San Francisco to take part in CloudStock - the premier event for cloud application developers. And to amplify the fun, you can compete in CloudStock hackathon for one of [many prizes](http://www.cloudstockevent.com/cloudstockhackathon), among others also a GoodData prize for Best Analytic Innovation.

With the hacking [now started](http://blog.cloudstockevent.com/blog/2010/12/let-the-hacking-begin/), we wanted to give you a short jump-start guide to get you running quickly:

* register for a [free account](https://secure.gooddata.com/registration.html)
* we've created a command-line utility called [GoodData CL](/gooddata-cl) to help you use GoodData APIs
* watch this [quick screencast](http://developer.gooddata.com/start/load-in-5-minutes.html) showing you a setup of a sample analytical project (follow the text along, download all the sample scripts)
* here's a bit [more background](http://developer.gooddata.com/start/) on what's happening under-the-hood

If you're playing around with GoodData APIs, please give us a shout at [@gooddata_dev](http://twitter.com/gooddata_dev) or our [Developer Forum](http://support.gooddata.com/forums/176660-developer-forum). We'll be focusing heavily to help you move quickly.

And of course, come see us on CloudStock. We'll be both manning the booth and roaming the hackathon, some of our best developers giving you hands-on support on the spot. We're excited to see what you come up with!
