1. You need to work with at least two Cloudstock partners, and GoodData already has connectors to Salesforce and Google Analytics. We can show you a demo mashup with Twilio. We are running on Amazon Web Services. It just cannot be easier.

2. ReadWriteWeb wants to see the best data vizualization. I believe it's not about the most fancy chart, it's about a great idea what to visualize. Once you have the idea, coding it in GoodData will be a pleasure. You just need to be prepared for the fame.

3. You can win the latest iPod Touch 32 GB. We are sponsoring the Best Analytic Innovation award. Think out of the boxâ€“you're developer, after all. 

Our top developers are here to help you. Feel free to ask us! We will not code your app but we help you keep moving.

If you decide to be a hackathoner, [follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/gooddata_dev) and don't forget to [register your team by 1:15pm](http://www.developerforce.com/events/hackathon/registration.php)!
