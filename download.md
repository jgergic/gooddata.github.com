# GoodData CL
A quick, easy-to-use **command-line** utility that wraps access to our APIs. It executes short scripts that can be run and configured automatically. Features include:

 * **create projects** &mdash; <em>allows you to automatically create new projects on the fly</em>
 * **create a data model** &mdash; <em>helps you describe relationship in your data and create a logical data model in GoodData</em>
 * **extract data from DBs, online apps** &mdash; <em>built-in connectors to any JDBC driver, Google Analytics, Salesforce</em>
 * **…and even more** &mdash; <em>partial loads, data snapshotting, time dimension mapping and more…</em>

By being command-line driven, it can be easily included as part of an automated integration workflow.
