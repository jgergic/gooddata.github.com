# Welcome
You can use GooData in several different ways. Here is how to choose which one you should start with:

* [GoodData CL](/gooddata-cl) is a command-line tool for GoodData API. It offers the most functions, is completely scriptable, but some programming experience is recommended.
* [GoodData Snap]() is a plugin for SnapLogic - a visual modeling/transformation tool. You cat get started quickly, in the browser, no programming required. But you'll need a SnapLogic license. (There is a 30-day trial to get you started.)
* _GoodData Ruby Gem &mdash; not ready yet_
