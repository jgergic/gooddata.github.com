# Welcome
You can use GooData in several different ways. Here is how to choose which one you should start with:

* [GoodData CL](load-in-5-minutes.html) is a command-line tool for GoodData API. It offers the most functions, is completely scriptable, but some programming experience is recommended.

* [GoodData Snap](intro-to-snaplogic.html) is a plugin for SnapLogic - a visual modeling/transformation tool. You cat get started quickly, in the browser, no programming required. But you'll need a SnapLogic license. (There is a 30-day trial to get you started.)
